  <p> Vanity Fair Antiques and Collectibles Mall began decades ago as a family-owned business. Located on Antiques Row (Fort Street) in the beautiful Victoria, BC, it now houses antiques from dozens of vendors in one convenient place.

Our collections include jewellery, china, toys, dolls, and even clothing and accessories.
